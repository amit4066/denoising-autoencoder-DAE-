# Building Image Denoising Autoencoder in Keras

# About

The aim of this Project is to build a denoising autoencoder (DAE) with CNN to to remove noise from low resolution photographs.

# Data set 

CIFAR10 image dataset has been imported from Keras.

### Tasks:

**Task 1**: Data Exploration and Preparation 
* Explore and visualize characteristics of the provided data. 
* Prepare data for image denoising.

**Task 2:** Image Denoising  
* Experiment with the provided partial Autoencoder models.
* Select the best and improve its performance.
* Report all your experimental work.
